It will help us understand the probability theory we will later introduce for numeric and continuous data, which is more common in data science applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete probability is more useful in card games and we use these as examples. The word probability is used in everyday language. For example, Google's auto complete of, what are the chances of, gives us getting pregnant, having twins, and rain tomorrow. Answering questions about probability is often hard, if not impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we discuss a mathematical definition of probability that does permit us to give precise answers to certain questions. For example, if I have two red beads and three blue beads inside an urn and I pick one at random, what is the probability of picking a red one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intuition tells us that the answer is 2/5, or 40%. A precise definition can be given by noting that there are five possible outcomes of which two satisfy the condition necessary for the event \"pick a red bead.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Because each of the five outcomes has the same chance of occurring, we conclude that the probability is 0.4 for red and 0.6 for blue. A more tangible way to think about **the probability of an event is as a proportion of times the event occurs when we repeat the experiment over and over independently and under the same conditions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue, let's introduce some notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the notation $Pr(A)$ probability of A to denote the probability of an event A happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the very general term **event** to refer to things that can happen when something happens by chance. For example, in our previous example, the event was picking a red bead. In a political poll, in which we call 100 likely voters at random, an example of an event is calling 48 Democrats and 52 Republicans. \n",
    "\n",
    "In data science applications, we will often deal with **continuous variables**. In these cases, events will often be things like, is this person taller than 6 feet? In this case, we write events in a more mathematical form. For example, x greater than 6. We'll see more of these examples later. Here, we focus on categorical data and discrete probability.\n"

This calculation is 1/13-- chance of getting an ace-- times the chance of getting a card with value 10 given that we already saw an ace, which is 16 out of 51. We've already taking one card out.

If we want to compute the probability of this happening, we want to enumerate the combinations, not permutations, since the order doesn't matter. So if we get an A and a king, king and an A, it's still a 21. We don't want to count that twice. So notice the difference between the permutations functions, which lists all permutations, and the combination function, where order does not matter."

    "All right. Now let's move on to the second one. The probability that the second person has a unique birthday given that person 1 already took one other day is 364 divided by 365. Then for a person 3, given that the first two people already have unique birthdays, that leaves 363. So now that probability is 363 divided by 365. \n",

    "dot, all the way to the 50th element. Here's the equation. Now, we can easily write a function that does this. This time we'll call it exact prob. It takes n as a argument, and it computes this probability using the simple code. Now we can compute each probably for each n using sapply again, like this. And if we plot it, we can see that the Monte Carlo simulations were almost exactly right. They were almost exact approximations of the actual value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an example with the birthday problem. We're going to use n equals 22. There's 22 people. So we're going to run a simulation where we compute or estimate the probability of two people having a certain birthday using different sizes of the Monte Carlo simulations. \n",

    "So the value of b going to go from 10, to 20, to 40, to 100, et cetera. We compute the simulation, and now we look at the values that we get for each simulation. Remember, each simulation has a different b, a different number of experiments."

    "#### Addition Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we showed you how to compute the probability of a natural 21 in blackjack. This is getting a face card and an ace in your first draw.\n",
    "Here, we're going to show you the **addition rule**, which gives you another way to compute this probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <u>additional rule tells us that the probability of A or B</u>, right, we're going to have to make this calculation now, because you can get to 21 in two ways. You can get either a face card and then an ace. Or you can get an ace and then a face card.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're asking what's the problem of that or? A or B?\n",
    "The additional rule tells us the probability of A or B is the probably of A plus the probably a B minus the probability of A and B. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pr (A or B) = Pr (A) + Pr (B) - Pr (A and B)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why this makes sense, think of a Venn diagram. If we're computing the probability of this whole thing happening, A or B, we can add the blue circle plus the pink circle, and then subtract the middle because we have added it twice by adding the blue plus the pink. So it makes sense-- the addition rule makes a lot of sense. So now let's apply it to the natural 21. In the case of natural 21, the intersection is empty. Since both hands can't happen, you can't have both an ace and then a face card, and then at the same time have a face card and then an ace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those two things can't happen at the same time. So this will be a very easy application of the addition rule. The probably of an ace followed by a face card we know is 1 over 13 times 16 divided by 51 **(4/52 X 16/51 = 1/13 X 16/51)**. And the probability of a face card followed by an ace is 16 over 52 times 4 over 51 **(16/52 X 4/51)**. These are actually the same, which makes sense to the symmetry.These two values are actually the same. In any case, we get the same result that we got before for the natural 21, which is about 0.05."

    "At some point in the game, contestants were asked to pick one of three doors. Behind one door, there was a prize. The other two had a goat behind them. And this basically meant that you lost. If the contestant did not pick the prize door on his or her first try, Monty Hall would open one of the two remaining doors\n",
    "and show the contestant that there was no prize behind that door. So you're left with two doors, the one you picked and one door that you do not know what's behind it.\n",

So the student converted it to inches, and copied and pasted the result into the place where they had to report their heights. The probably assigned to this height is about 0.001. It's 1 in 708. However, the probability for 70 inches is 0.12. This is much higher than what was reported with this other value.\n",

But rather, that people rounded to the nearest inch. With **continuous distributions**, the probability of a singular value is not even defined.\n",

    "We can easily generate random variables using some of the simple examples we have shown, such as the red and blue bead urn.\n",

    "For example, define x to be 1 if a bead is blue, and red otherwise. Here's a R code you can write to generate that random variable. X is a random variable.\n",

    "Every time we select a new bead, the outcome changes randomly. Sometimes it's 1, sometimes it's 0. Here's some examples of how that random variable changes. We're going to do it three times. Here is 0, here is 1, and here's 1 again. In data science, we often deal with data that is affected by chance in some way. The data comes from a random sample, the data is affected by measurement error, or the data measures some outcome that is random in nature.\n",

    ">Being able to quantify the uncertainty introduced by randomness is one of the most important jobs of a data scientist.\n",

    "**Statistical inference** offers a framework for doing this, as well as several practical tools. The first step is to learn how to mathematically describe random variables.\n",

    "### Sampling Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data-generation procedures, those that produce data that we study, can be modeled quite well as draws from an urn. For example, we can model the process of polling likely voters as drawing 0's-- Republicans-- and 1's-- Democrats-- from an urn containing the 0 and 1 code for all likely voters. We'll see that in more detail later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiological studies, we often assume that the subjects in our study\n",
    "are a random sample from the population of interest. The data related to a specific outcome can be modeled as a random sample from an urn containing the values for those outcomes for the entire population of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in experimental research, we often assume that the individual\n",
    "organisms we are studying-- for example, worms, flies, or mice-- are a random sample from a larger population. Randomized experiments can also be modeled by draws from urn, given the way individuals are assigned to groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "When getting assigned, you draw your group at random. Sampling models are therefore ubiquitous in data science. Casino games offer a plethora of examples of real-world situations in which sampling models are used to answer specific questions. We will therefore start with such examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's start with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a very small casino hires you to consult on whether they should set up a roulette wheel. They want to know if they can make money off it, or if it's too risky and they might lose. To keep the example simple, we will assume that 1,000 people will play, and that the only game you can play is to bet on red or black. The casino wants to predict how much money they will make or lose. They want a range of values that are possible,\n",
    "and in particular, they want to know, what is the chance of losing money?\n",
    "\n",
    "If this probability is too high, they will pass on installing roulette wheels, since they can't take the risk, given that they need to pay their employees and keep the lights on. We're going to define a random variable, capital `S`, that will represent the casino's total winnings. Let's start by constructing the urn, the urn we use for our sampling model.\n",
    "\n",
    "A roulette wheel has 18 red pockets, 18 black pockets, and 2 green ones.\n",
    "So playing a color in one game of roulette is equivalent to drawing from this urn. Let's write some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's 18 black, 18 red, and 2 green. \n"

    "\n",
    "Previously we described how any list of numbers, let's call it $x_1\\dots x_n$, has a distribution. The definition is quite straightforward. We define capital F(a) as a function that answers the question, <u>what **proportion** of the list is less than or equal to a?</u> Because they are useful summaries, when the distribution is approximately normal, we define the average and the standard deviation. These are defined with a straightforward operation of the list. In r we simply compute the average and standard deviation this way, for example. \n",

    "A random variable x has a distribution function. To define this, we do not need a list of numbers. It's a theoretical concept. In this case, to define the distribution, we define capital F(a) as a function that answers the question, <u>what is the **probability** that x is less than or equal to a?</u> There is no list of numbers. However, if x is defined by drawing from an urn with numbers in it, then there is a list, the list of numbers inside the urn. In this case, the distribution of that list\n",
    "is the probability distribution of x and the average and standard deviation of that list are the expected value and standard errors of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about it that does not involve an urn is to run a Monte Carlo simulation and generate a very large list of outcomes of x.\n",
    "These outcomes are a list of numbers. The distribution of this list will be a very good approximation of the probability distribution of x.\n",
    "The longer the list, the better the approximation. The average and standard deviation of this list will approximate the expected value and standard error of the random variable."

    "The first important concept to learn is the **expected value**. In statistics books, it is common to use the letter capital E, like this, E of X equals $\\mu$, to denote that the expected value of the random variable X is $\\mu$. $\\mu$ is a Greek letter for M, which is the first letter in the word mean, which is a synonym with average.\n",
